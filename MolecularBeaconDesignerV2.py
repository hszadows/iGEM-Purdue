# Input: DNA sequence to screen for the optimal subsequence for use as 
#   a molecular beacon probe.
# Output: I'm not quite sure what all it'll output. Certainly some beacon 
#   candidates at the very least. Currently it outputs what it thinks is the
#   best molecular beacon. bestBeaconIndices holds the indices of the best 
#   beacons in descending order of goodness. Index through mfoldSequences to 
#   check out the possible beacons and screen the output for the beacon you 
#   prefer.
# It is fairly common for the code not to find a good beacon. If this is the 
#   case, bestBeaconIndices will be populated exclusively by 0s and the code 
#   will output the first candidate sequence from mfoldSequences. This does 
#   not mean you should use this as a beacon. This means you should get a 
#   different internal oligo. 

# EVERY DNA SEQUENCE IS 5' TO 3' UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.

# A note on running this code: I seriously doubt your python compiler / IDE 
# has access to selenium, which is required for my code. You'll need to 
# enable python to run in your Windows command terminal (look it up), then use
# the command "pip install selenium". If this doesn't work and you have 
# Anaconda (Spyder), you could try "conda install selenium". 

# Hey uh also go download the most recent stable Chrome webdriver and put it
# in your python path. Look up "chrome webdriver" and it should be among the
# top 3 results.
